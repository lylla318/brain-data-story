      <!-- CONTEXT INFO -->

      <div class="context">

          It is commonly shown that poverty has many effects on a child's development. A child raised in poverty is five times more likely to drop out of high school [1]. They are statistically more likely to score below average on state exams [2]. They are nearly half as likely to enroll in higher education compared to their high income peers [3]. Are these facts simply situational… or is there something physiological going on? 

          <br><br>

          Our research shows otherwise. According to a study recently published in JAMA Pediatrics, there is correlation between poverty in children and the development of brain matter. “Poverty is tied to structural differences in several areas of the brain associated with school readiness skills, with the largest influence observed among children from the poorest households the poorest households… 

          <br><br>

          These developmental differences had consequences for children’s academic achievement. On average, children from low-income households scored 4 to 7 points lower on standardized tests (P less than 0.05). As much as 20% of the gap in test scores could be explained by explained by maturational lags in the frontal and temporal lobes” [4]. These developmental differences can be explored below.

          The effect of poverty on the brain can be seen beyond the physical brain matter. These effects were examined through the National Health Interview Survey, issued by the US Center for Disease Control [5]. Through this data, relationships between poverty and ADHD, autism, and learning disabilities are seen. This can be examined below.

          The “p-value” displayed below can be use to gauge your findings. This value is an indicator of statistical significance. When a p-value is below a chosen threshold, the relationship shown is very unlikely to appear as a result of random noise. In the social sciences, the typical threshold is .05. This means that if p < .05, the relationship between poverty and a given disorder is strong.

        As described above, a child living in poverty has a higher probability of being diagnosed with ADHD, autism, or a learning disability. These developmental effects have impact throughout a young person’s life, including in their opportunities for higher education. As discussed earlier, a child in poverty is nearly half as likely to enroll in college; is this simply due to cost? The College Board, who administers the SAT exam, reports demographic data about test takers [6]. The impact of poverty is explored below in terms of SAT scores below.

        Poverty has been shown to have statistically significant impact on brain development, development of ADHD, autism, and learning disabilities, as well as on SAT scores. Where does this leave us? This information is meant to be a call to action. As the National Center for Children in Poverty states, “More than 16 million children in the United States – 22% of all children – live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level… Research is clear that poverty is the single greatest threat to children’s well-being. But effective public policies – to make work pay for low-income parents and to provide high-quality early care and learning experiences for their children – can make a difference. Investments in the most vulnerable children are also critical” [7].
